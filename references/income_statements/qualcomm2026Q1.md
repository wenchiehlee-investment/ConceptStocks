### Segment Revenue Comparison

| Segment | Reference (% × total) | Our CSV (QCT segments from 8-K) | Match |
|---------|----------------------:|--------------------------------:|-------|
| Handsets | ~$7.84B (64%) | $7.82B | ✅ |
| IoT | ~$1.72B (14%) | $1.69B | ✅ |
| Automotive | ~$1.10B (9%) | $1.10B | ✅ |
| QTL Licensing | ~$1.59B (13%) | Not tracked (excluded) | N/A |

> **Note**: QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) is excluded from our QCT segment tracking because its table format makes reliable parsing difficult.

### Income Comparison

| Metric | Reference | Our CSV (SEC EDGAR GAAP) | Match |
|--------|----------:|--------------------------:|-------|
| Revenue | $12.25B | $12.25B | ✅ |
| EPS | $3.50 (non-GAAP) | $2.78 (GAAP) | Expected diff |
| Net Income | — | $3.00B | — |

> **EPS discrepancy**: Reference uses non-GAAP EPS ($3.50). Our CSV extracts GAAP EPS from SEC EDGAR XBRL ($2.78). Non-GAAP excludes stock compensation and amortization charges, resulting in a higher non-GAAP figure.

**Result: CONSISTENT** - Revenue and QCT segment percentages match well. EPS difference is expected (GAAP vs non-GAAP).
