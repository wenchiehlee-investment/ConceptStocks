## Comparison with Our Data

### Historical OCI Revenue (from quarterly breakdown image)

| FY | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Annual |
|----|----|----|----|----|--------|
| 2023 | $0.9B | $1.0B | $1.2B | $1.4B | $4.5B |
| 2024 | $1.5B | $1.6B | $1.8B | $2.0B | $6.9B |
| 2025 | $2.2B | $2.4B | $2.7B | $3.0B | $10.3B |
| 2026 | $3.3B | - | - | - | ~$18B (projected) |

### Verification

- FY2025 forecast ($10B) matches quarterly sum ($10.3B) - **CONSISTENT**
- FY2026 Q1 OCI = $3.3B, annualized = $13.2B, but forecast = $18B
  - This implies significant acceleration in remaining quarters

## Context: AI Infrastructure Demand

Oracle's aggressive OCI forecast is driven by:
1. **AI training workloads** - GPU clusters for LLM training
2. **Enterprise cloud migration** - Moving from on-premise to cloud
3. **Multi-cloud strategy** - Customers using OCI alongside AWS/Azure

The $114B FY2029 projection would make OCI comparable to current AWS revenue (~$90B/year), though this is an optimistic forecast.

## Data Quality Note

This is a **forward-looking projection**, not historical data. Actual results may vary significantly based on:
- AI market growth trajectory
- Competition from AWS, Azure, GCP
- Oracle's ability to expand data center capacity
