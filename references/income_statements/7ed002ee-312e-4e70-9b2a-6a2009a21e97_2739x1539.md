## Data Availability from CSV Schema

### What CAN be parsed from SEC 6-K filings (Exhibit 99.2 presentation HTML)

| Field | Source | CSV Column (Type 34) |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| Revenue $33.7B | `Net Revenue (US$ billions)` in text | `total_revenue` |
| Gross Profit $21.0B | derived: revenue × gross_margin % | `gross_profit` |
| Gross Margin 62.3% | `Gross Margin xx.x%` in text | `gross_margin` |
| Operating Expenses ($2.8B) | `Operating Expenses (NT$B)` ÷ FX rate | `operating_expenses` |
| Operating Income $18.2B | derived: revenue × operating_margin % | `operating_income` |
| Operating Margin 54.0% | `Operating Margin xx.x%` in text | `operating_margin` |
| Other Income $0.9B | `Non-Operating Items (NT$B)` ÷ FX rate | `other_income` |
| Net Income $16.3B | derived: revenue × net_margin % | `net_income` |
| Net Margin 48.3% | `Net Profit Margin xx.x%` in text | `net_margin` |
| EPS NT$19.50 | `EPS (NT$) xx.xx` in text | `eps` (NT$, not USD) |

### What CANNOT be parsed (embedded as chart images in slides)

| Field | Reason | Alternative |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| R&D ($2.1B) | Inside aggregate Operating Expenses; not broken out in text | Manual entry from PDF |
| SG&A ($0.8B) | Same as above | Manual entry from PDF |
| Tax ($2.8B) | Derivable only if `income_before_tax` is parsed (available in NT$ table) | Derived |
| **HPC 55% (+2pp)** | Slide 7 chart image — text only shows slide title "4Q25 Revenue by Platform" | Manual entry from PDF / FMP |
| **Smartphones 32% (-3pp)** | Same as above | Same |
| **IoT / Automotive / DCE / Others** | Same as above | Same |
| Segment revenue (USD) | % × total revenue (can be derived once % is available) | Derived after manual % |

### Implementation Status

- ✅ TSM added to `COMPANY_CIK` and `FISCAL_YEAR_END_MONTH` in `sec_edgar_client.py`
- ✅ `get_6k_income_statement()` method added in `sec_edgar_client.py` — confirmed working (Q4 FY2025: $33.7B revenue)
- ✅ `QUARTERLY_6K_INCOME_SUPPORTED = ['TSM']` constant defined in `generate_quarterly_segments.py`
- ✅ Type 34 schema extended: `operating_expenses`, `other_income`, `income_before_tax`, `tax`, `revenue_yoy_pct`
- ✅ Type 35 schema extended: `pct_of_revenue`
- ✅ `update_company_financials.py` dispatches to `get_6k_income_statement()` for symbols in `FOREIGN_FILERS_6K` (TSM). Income CSV now populated with 11 quarters of TSM data (FY2023 Q1 – FY2025 Q4), source=`SEC_6K`.
- ✅ `generate_quarterly_segments.py` wired up: calls `fetch_6k_income_totals()` in `main()` → populates `total_revenue_map` → TSM Total Revenue row appears in markdown report. `generate_markdown_report()` extended with `income_only_symbols` parameter for income-only companies.
- ⚠️ Platform segment % requires manual data entry (PDF slides, not text-parseable) — FY2025 Q2 also missing (6-K format different or filing pattern mismatch)

## Comparison with Our Data

**TSMC (TSM) is partially tracked** (CIK: 0001046179). Infrastructure exists but pipeline scripts need to be wired up to call `get_6k_income_statement()`. Revenue of $33.7B for Q4 FY2025 confirmed via direct API test.

TSMC is a semiconductor foundry (contract manufacturer) rather than a fabless chip designer. Our tracked companies (NVDA, AMD, QCOM, etc.) are customers of TSMC. Key observations:

- **HPC dominance** (55%): Driven by AI accelerator demand from NVIDIA, AMD, and others
- **Smartphone decline** (32%, -3pp): Reflects seasonal mix and slower smartphone recovery
- **Automotive growth** (+1pp): Consistent with broader automotive chip demand trends
- **Strong margins**: 62% gross margin and 48% net margin reflect TSMC's pricing power on advanced nodes (3nm, 5nm)

**Note**: TSMC's revenue growth (+25% Y/Y) is consistent with AI-driven demand seen across our tracked fabless companies (NVDA Data Center +150%+ in FY2025).
